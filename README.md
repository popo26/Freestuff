# FreeStuff

## What this app does:
FreeStuff is a simple and intuitive app that provides a place to exchange unwanted free stuff.
[Demo site](https://demo-freestuff.herokuapp.com/)

## Technology:
- Python 3
- Flask

## Preparation for virtualenv, AWS S3 Bucket, and .env_example file:
1. Once clone or download this code, [create a virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
2. Acticate the virtualenv.
3. From terminal, install all the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. I use [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to access environment variables.
5. Set up [AWS S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html). Fill related sections in the `.env_example` file.
6. SECRET_KEY, DANGEROUS_SECRET, and SALTIES need whatever keys you enter. e.g. SECRET_KEY=asidfwieidf;askjwiejfasdjfwiejfaskdljfawioejfadkjf.
7. If you don't have PostgreSQL installed on your computer, please refer to this [page](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/installation.html). e.g. DATABASE_URL=postgresql://*your_db_username*:*your_db_password*@localhost:5432/*your_db_name*
8. I use gmail for MAIL_USERNAME in .env_example. MAIL_PASSWORD uses App Password, which is different from your normal gmail password.
   Please find instructions for how to generate [App Password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en).
9. The email address set for MAIL_USERNAME will be your admin email address.
10. Not necessary but I use [PGAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to see PostgreSQL data in GUI.

## Database setup:

1. Enter following commands in CLI.
- `flask shell`
- `from app import db, fake`
- `from app.models import Role, User, Post, Photo`
2. Set roles. By default, all users are set to User(not Administrator).
- `Role.insert_roles()`
3. Add sample users and posts.
- `fake.users(20)`
- `fake.posts(30)`
- `exit()`

## Run the app:
1. From terminal, run below commands to launch the site, then go to `127.0.0.1:5000`.:
- `export FLASK_APP=freestuff.py`
- `export FLASK_DEBUG=1`
- `export FLASK_ENV=development`
- `flask run`


## Run tests(db insersion, hashed password creation, and slug creation):
- Run this command `python -m pytest tests/` in CLI.

## Hightlights:
1. There are 2 search methods - Category search & Keyword search.
2. Only registered users are allowed to see member profiles, sending and receiving messages about a post, and contacting FreeStuff admin.
3. Password reset is availiable by sending reset link at login screen or after an user logs in at Profile page.
4. Admin is allowed to edit user profiles and user posts in the site.
5. A new user needs to confirm a token email before login first time.
6. Emain notification will be sent when an user asks question and also receives an answer.
